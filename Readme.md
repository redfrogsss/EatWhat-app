# EatWhat App

The mobile app version of the website [EatWhat](https://github.com/redfrogsss/EatWhat). 

## What is this?

This app allows users to start a vote and ask their friends to choose what to eat for the lunch or dinner. 

This app tries to solve a simple yet annoying problem: `What should we eat for lunch / dinner?`. To solve this problem, the user who start the vote need to input a set of options for lunch / dinner. Then, his/her friends could enter the vote using a code and choose their preferred options or choose randomly by clicking a button. At the end, the option with the highest votes will be the final choice.
